= Pilha

A object oriented wrapper for the StackExchange/StackOverflow API

== Why such a strange name?

'Pilha' (pronounced peeleeah) means 'stack' in portuguese.

== Instalation

  gem install pilha

== Example

Pilha aims to provide a ActiveRecord like interface for querying the StackExchange API.

  include StackExchange::StackOverflow
  StackExchange::StackOverflow::Client.config do |options|
    options.api_key = 'your_key' #optional
  end

  Badge.all # returns all badges
  User.find_by_badge_id(2) # returns all users awarded by the badge identified with 'id'

  q = Question.find_by_user_id(91970) # returns all the questions for user with id = '91970'
  q.questions.first # returns the first question in the collection of questions returned
  q.questions.count # returns the number of questions returned in that query

  t = Question.find_by_tags('Ruby') # returns all the questions that are tagged 'Ruby'
  
  List of available methods for Questions are:
  all(options = {})
  find(id, options = {})
  find_by_user_id(id, options = {})
  find_favorites_by_user_id(id, options = {})
  find_by_tags(*tags)
  unanswered(options = {})
  parse(response)
  id
